logical equations, the difference between && || ['\
There are difference between i++ and ++i. For example, if i = 5, then i++ will first give you 5 then 6
However, for ++i, it immediately gives you the answer instead of showing you the steps.
Eg: ++i when i = 5, gives you 6 instead of 5, 6

Operator precedence

Short circuit evaluation allows for safe execution in cases of potential division by 0 or null
pointer exception.

Iterations：

The while loop: repeatedly executes its body as long as a logical test is true

but in order for the while loop to work, you actually will have to update the value in the loop,
or else it will run forever. For example ++, or --, or +=1, etc inside the loop.

Infinite loop:
which is using while without the "{}"
will repeat infinite times, the changes and stuff added below them will not work
