    /*
a class in programming defines a new abstract data type. A class is the formal
implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object.
- When you create objects or instances of a class in coding, you create new variables or
objects of that class data type.
Eg: Scanner scanner = new scanner, Scanner is either a file or blueprint, scanner is an object
class: a program entity that represents a template for a new type of objects.
object or instance: An entity that combines attributes(data) and behavior(methods).
    -object-oriented programming(OOP):Programs that perform their behavior as interactions
between objects. Java is object-oriented.
EG: The car class is a template for creating Car objects.

what is null?
parameter?
difference between static and stuff
what is static when use static when not use static
private modifier?
OOP?
constructor: is a method which is used to instantiate an object
compareTo() lexicographic order?????
upper case letters are smaller than lower case letters G<g
differences between primitive and reference

Unit 2
Method signature: A method signature for a method consists of the method name and the ordered, possibly
empty, list of parameter types.
Method returns: Methods in java can have return types. Such non-void methods return value back that can
be used by the program. A method can use the keyboard "return" to return a value.
Wrong: public void output(){
    System.out.println("Hello");
    }
    System.out.println(output()) is wrong
Return: to send out a value as the result of a method
The opposide of a parameter:
-Parameters send information in from the caller to the method
-Return values send information out from a method to its called
-A call to the method can be used as part of an expression
Common error happening to students: Many students forget to store the result of a method call

Escape Sequences: A special sequence of characters used to represent certain special characters
in a string. \n new line character
\" quotation mark character
\\ backslash character
