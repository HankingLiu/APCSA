Iteration: For loops
Categories of loop:
Indefinite loop: One where the number of times its body repeats is not known in advance.
    - Prompt the user until they type a non-negative number
    - Print random numbers until a prime number is printed.
    - Repeat until the user types "q" to quit
The while loop is usually used for indefinite loop

Definite loop: Executes a known number of times
    - Print "hello" ten times
    - Find all the prime numbers up to an integer n.
The for loop is usually used for definite loop
eg. for(int i = 0, i<n, ++){
        do something
        }
Perform initialization once,
